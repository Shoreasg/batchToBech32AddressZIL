This tool is created because i realized that https://ide.zilliqa.com/#/ tools only allow one address to be converted.

With this tool, you can add multiple base16 address and it will convert to bech32 shown in output.

Known issues:

If you enter an invalid address and click submit, the whole app will crash. Have to refresh the page and try again(Fixed on 14/11/2022)
